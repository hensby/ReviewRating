### Step3
Upload the model and Word2Vec by using gcloud commend or using ssh brower window. Upload the files under **"static/"**.

### Step4
Install the Project Dependencies by using the commend below.
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt --user
```
```
export FLASK_APP=review_rating.py
flask run --host=0.0.0.0
```

### Setp5
Expose the Flask HTTP port (5000) from the VMâ€™s firewall. This is done via gcloud tools in your local development environment.
```
gcloud compute firewall-rules create open-flask-rule --allow tcp:5000 --source-tags=flask-demo --source-ranges=0.0.0.0/0
```
Or you can set the firewall in yout Google Instance in the browser.
